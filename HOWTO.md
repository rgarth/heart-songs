# Heart Songs - Implementation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and implementing the Heart Songs Game step by step.

## Step 1: Project Setup

1. Create the project structure as outlined in the Project Structure section
2. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   mkdir heart-songs-game
   cd heart-songs-game
   npm init -y
   ```
3. Create a React app for the frontend:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app client
   ```

## Step 2: Backend Setup

1. Install the necessary backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose axios cors dotenv querystring
   npm install --save-dev nodemon
   ```

2. Set up the `.env` file with your Spotify API credentials and MongoDB connection string

3. Create the MongoDB models:
   - User model
   - Game model
   - Question model

4. Implement the Express server and routes:
   - Authentication routes
   - Game routes
   - Spotify API service routes

5. Create the database seed script for questions

## Step 3: Frontend Setup

1. Install the necessary frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install axios react-router-dom
   npm install --save-dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   cd ..
   ```

2. Set up Tailwind CSS:
   - Configure the `tailwind.config.js` file
   - Add Tailwind directives to your CSS file

3. Implement the React components:
   - Authentication context
   - API service functions
   - Page components
   - Game state components

## Step 4: Spotify Integration

1. Register your application with Spotify:
   - Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard
   - Create a new application
   - Set the redirect URI to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback`

2. Implement the Spotify authentication flow:
   - Redirect to Spotify authorization page
   - Handle the callback with authorization code
   - Exchange code for access tokens
   - Set up token refresh mechanism

3. Integrate the Spotify Web API:
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add playlist creation
   - Enable adding tracks to playlists

4. Implement the Spotify Web Playback SDK:
   - Add the SDK script to your index.html
   - Initialize the player when needed
   - Set up play/pause controls

## Step 5: Game Logic Implementation

1. Create the game flow logic:
   - Game creation and joining
   - Player ready status
   - Question selection
   - Song submission
   - Voting mechanism
   - Score tracking
   - Next round functionality

2. Set up real-time data polling:
   - Implement interval-based state updates
   - Handle game state transitions

## Step 6: Testing and Deployment

1. Test the application locally:
   - Verify authentication flow
   - Test game creation and joining
   - Check song selection and voting
   - Ensure score tracking works correctly

2. Prepare for deployment:
   - Update URLs for production
   - Set up build process for React frontend
   - Configure MongoDB connection for production

3. Deploy to your chosen platform:
   - Backend: Heroku, Render, or similar
   - Frontend: Netlify, Vercel, or similar
   - Database: MongoDB Atlas

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Spotify Authentication Issues**
   - Ensure redirect URLs match exactly
   - Check that all required scopes are included
   - Verify token refresh is working correctly

2. **Playlist Creation Problems**
   - Ensure the user has granted the proper permissions
   - Check that access tokens are valid when making requests
   - Verify the correct Spotify user ID is being used

3. **Game State Synchronization**
   - Make sure polling interval is appropriate
   - Check that state updates are being applied correctly
   - Ensure all players are seeing the same game state

4. **Playback SDK Issues**
   - Ensure the SDK is loaded before attempting to use it
   - Check that the device is registered correctly
   - Verify that the access token has the right scopes

## Next Steps and Enhancements

Once you have the basic game working, consider these enhancements:

1. Add Socket.io for real-time updates instead of polling
2. Implement user profiles and persistent game history
3. Add more types of questions and game modes
4. Create a mobile-responsive design
5. Add animations and transitions for a better user experience
6. Implement private game rooms with passwords
7. Add chat functionality for players
8. Create custom themes or game templates
